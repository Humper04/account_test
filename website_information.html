    <h1>Website Information and Features</h1>
    <h2>Security Measures</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Password Hashing:</strong> Passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt before being stored or logged, ensuring they are never exposed in plain text.</li>
        <li><strong>Session Management:</strong> Sessions are managed securely with session IDs regenerated upon login to prevent session fixation attacks.</li>
        <li><strong>SQL Injection Prevention:</strong> All SQL queries are conducted using prepared statements to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.</li>
        <li><strong>Rate Limiting:</strong> Login attempts are limited to prevent brute force attacks, with users locked out after several failed attempts.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>User-Friendly Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Consistent Validation:</strong> Email and phone number validation are consistently enforced across both registration and profile modification to maintain data integrity.</li>
        <li><strong>Intuitive Navigation:</strong> Direct links between login, registration, and profile modification pages facilitate user navigation and enhance user experience.</li>
        <li><strong>Clear Error Messages:</strong> User feedback does not disclose specific security settings while providing clear, actionable messages. Enhanced error messaging now clarifies when usernames, emails, and/or phone numbers are already in use.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Error Handling and Logging</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Log Management:</strong> Both successful and unsuccessful login attempts are logged with details such as username/email/phone number, hashed password, and IP address for auditing purposes.</li>
        <li><strong>Input Validation:</strong> Input validation for emails and phone numbers is rigorously applied to prevent incorrect data submissions and enhance security.</li>
    </ul>
